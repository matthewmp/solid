    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <pre>
        // ie. Cash Register
        
        class CashRegister1 {
            constructor(){
                this.subTotal = 0;
                this.taxRate = 7.5;
                this.grandTotal = 0;
            }

            calculateTotal(){
                this.grandTotal = this.subTotal + (this.subTotal * this.taxRate);
                this.emailReceipt(`Thanks, your total was: ${this.grandTotal}`);
            }

            emailReceipt(message){
                console.log(`Sending Email: ${message}`);
            }
        }
    </pre>
    
    <p>Question: Should the cash register be concerned with emailing a receipt?</p>
    <p>
        Answer: No, there should be an email class that handles this that way if
        the way customers are emailed change you would have to change every class that
        has this email logic.  However if the email logic is decoupled into it's own class
        we can handle all changes in 1 place.
    </p>

    <h6>New Implementation</h6>

    <pre>
        // Email Class
        export class Email {
            static sendMessage(message){
                console.log(`Sending Email: ${message}`);
            }
        }
    </pre>

    <pre>
        // CashRegister Class

        import { Email } from './email.class';
        
        class CashRegister2 {
            constructor(){
                this.subTotal = 0;
                this.taxRate = 7.5;
                this.grandTotal = 0;
            }

            calculateTotal(){
                this.grandTotal = this.subTotal + (this.subTotal * this.taxRate);
                <span class="highlight">Email.sendMessage(`Thanks, your total was: ${this.grandTotal}`);</span>
            }
    </pre>

    <p>Now if something in the Email class changes no changes need to be made to the CashRegister Class</p>

        <blockquote>
            If the behaviors of all the modules in your system could be extended, without modifying them, then you could add new features to that system without modifying any old code. The features would be added solely by writing new code.

            Whatâ€™s more, since none of the old code had changed, it would not need to be recompiled, and therefore it would not need to be redeployed. Adding a new feature would involve leaving the old code in place and only deploying the new code

    <h1>Interface Segregation</h1>

    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <p>
        Lets say we are making a game where you can build an army.  The army is broken up
        into separate sub types (archers, swordsmen, wizards etc).  Each subtype has the 
        ability to attack, rest, eat etc.

        A poor example of a class to bring these characters to life would be:
    </p>

    <pre>
    // Start by making a super class of soldier with a generic ability to attack
    class bad_Soldier{
        constructor(){
            this.lifeEnergy = 10;
        }

        sleep(){
            console.log('I am sleeping');
        }

        eat(){
            console.log('I am eating');
        }

        shootArrow(){
            console.log('I am attacking');
        }

        swingSword(){
            console.log('I am swinging swoord');
            }

            useMagic(){
                console.log('Casting spell');
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        The above class has every attack capability of an Archer, Swordsman, and Wizzard.
        One could extend this class for an Archer and simply not use the other attack methods.
        ie:
    </p>
    <pre>
        class bad_Archer extends bad_Soldier{
            constructor(){
                super();
            }

            attack(){
                this.shootArrow();
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        Once instatiated you could simply use the attack method to shoot arrows.
        Even though this would technically work there are all of the other 
        attack methods baked into this class under the hood.
        ie.
    </p>
    <pre>
        let archer0 = new bad_Archer();
        archer0.swingSword() // I am swinging swoord
    </pre>

    <p>
        An archer should not be able to attack with a sword.  These 
        instances have useless methods attached to them and can be accessed
        by other programmers unexpectedly.

        Using the Interface Segregation Principle we would abstract out the
        different attack modes then incorporate them into the appropriate 
        class later.

        ie
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all the original Soldier class breaks the Single Responsiblity Principle of
        S.O.L.I.D.  We should abstract out all of the characteristics that all soldiers will
        have and extend the subtypes of soldiers into their own class.

        ie.
    </p>
    <pre>
        class Soldier{
            constructor(){
                this.lifeEnergy = 10;
            }

            sleep(){
                console.log('I am sleeping');
            }

            eat(){
                console.log('I am eating');
            }
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        Now using the Interface Segregation principle we abstract out
        the various attack methods
    </p>

    <pre>
        const archerAttack = {
            shootArrow(){
                console.log('Shooting Arrow');
            }
        }

        const swordsmanAttack = {
            swingSword(){
                console.log('Swinging Sword');
            }
        }

        const wizardAttack = {
            castSpell(){
                console.log('Casting Spell');
            }
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
        Now we can extend the soldier class with the various subtypes
        ie.
    </p>

    <pre>
        class Archer extends Soldier{
            constructor(){
                super();
            }
        }

        class Swordsman extends Soldier{
            constructor(){
                super();
            }
        }

        class Wizard extends Soldier{
            constructor(){
                super();
            }
        }
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        Now we can assign the appropriate attack method to the 
        appropriate class using Object.assign on the prototype
        of each class
    </p>

    <pre>
        Object.assign(Archer.prototype, archerAttack);
        Object.assign(Swordsman.prototype, swordsmanAttack);
        Object.assign(Wizard.prototype, wizardAttack);

        let archer1 = new Archer();
        let swordsman1 = new Swordsman();
        let wizzard1 = new Wizard();

        archer1.shootArrow() //  Shooting Arrow 
        swordsman1.swingSword() //  Swinging Sword
        wizzard1.castSpell() //  Casting Spell
    </pre>

    <p>
        Now all of the instances have access to the 
        appropriate attack method without having
        any useless methods that are not needed.
