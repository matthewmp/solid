    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <pre>
        // ie. Cash Register
        
        class CashRegister {
            constructor(){
                this.subTotal = 0;
                this.taxRate = 7.5;
                this.grandTotal = 0;
            }

            calculateTotal(){
                this.grandTotal = this.subTotal + (this.subTotal * this.taxRate);
                this.emailReceipt(`Thanks, your total was: ${this.grandTotal}`);
            }

            emailReceipt(message){

            }
        }
    </pre>
    
    <p>Question: Should the cash register be concerned with emailing a receipt?</p>
    <p>
        Answer: No, there should be an email class that handles this that way if
        the way customers are emailed change you would have to change every class that
        has this email logic.  However if the email logic is decoupled into it's own class
        we can handle all changes in 1 place.
    </p>

    <h6>New Implementation</h6>

    <pre>
        // Email Class
        export class Email {
            static sendMessage(message){
                //
            }
        }
    </pre>

    <pre>
        // CashRegister Class

        import { Email } from './email.class';
        
        class CashRegister {
            constructor(){
                this.subTotal = 0;
                this.taxRate = 7.5;
                this.grandTotal = 0;
            }

            calculateTotal(){
                this.grandTotal = this.subTotal + (this.subTotal * this.taxRate);
                Email.emailReceipt(`Thanks, your total was: ${this.grandTotal}`);
            }

            emailReceipt(message){

            }
        }
    </pre>

    <p>Now if something in the Email class changes no changes need to be made to the CashRegister Class</p>

    <h1>O. Software should be Open for Extension and Closed for Modification</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Successful Use of Inheritance</li>
        <li>Allow Changes to Occur Easily</li>
        <li>A Well Written Class Should Not Have to be Re-Written in Order Integrate a New Feature</li>
    </ul>

        <blockquote>
            If the behaviors of all the modules in your system could be extended, without modifying them, then you could add new features to that system without modifying any old code. The features would be added solely by writing new code.

            Whatâ€™s more, since none of the old code had changed, it would not need to be recompiled, and therefore it would not need to be redeployed. Adding a new feature would involve leaving the old code in place and only deploying the new code
